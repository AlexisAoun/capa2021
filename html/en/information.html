                <h3>How will your 3 weeks of integration present itself?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>

                <br />
                <p>
                  Unfortunately we can not know the future, nevertheless we've anticipated the
                  most positive as well as the most negative scenarios. In any case you will have

                <h3>How is accomodated the MEUD ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  You can get a first glimpse of the housing offered by the school in
                  Douai by going to page 10 of the meudien guide. But the virtual tours
                  might give you a better glimpse: just go to the <a href="vieDouai.html" target="_blank">Life in Douai</a> page.
                  You can get additional information by going to the IMT Lille-Douai website
                  in the Student life accommodation:
                </p>
                <br>
                <a href="https://imt-lille-douai.fr/experience-etudiante/logements/" target="_blank">https://imt-lille-douai.fr/experience-etudiante/logements/</a>
                <br />
                <h3>How do you get housing at the MEUD?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  To stay at the MEUD, the residences of IMT Lille Douai in Douai, you must be
                  registered administratively at the school. This will give you your login details
                  to connect to MyServices, the IMT Lille Douai platform. Once logged in, click on
                  the “Housing” icon where you can pre-register. Pre-registrations will be available
                  around mid-June.

                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>What happens if you don't stay at the MEUD ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Damn, we weren't able convince you... Know that your school card will
                  still allow you to access the residences up to 9pm. You will not have
                  access to the car garage. Nevertheless you will of course still be able
                  to go to the school cafeteria, which is located in the Lavoisier residence.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>
                    Do you have a car and want to have access to the underground garage?
                </h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    This is possible for the fee of 22 euros per month when you are a
                    resident of the MEUD.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>Douai, is it really that bad ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Aaaaahhhh lets cut the chase. A lot of students have asked themselves that
                  question. Well Douai is not the most dynamic city you will ever visite, we're
                  in a provincial town where you can take pleasant stroll along the Scarpe.
                  Nevertheless fillot do not forget that this isn't it. The school atmosphere
                  will make you forget all the disadvantages of the North. Just remember, that
                  in the North we only cry twice: once when we arrive and another time when we leave.

                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>What is the workload?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Difficult to assess, as it depends on the individual. Regular work is enough to
                  pass the exams, and no worries you will not need to work 3 hours every night.
                  Nevertheless be careful fillot.e because your L3 grades are very important for
                  your application to foreign universities. In addition, your ranking will give you
                  priority (or not) for modules within the school.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h3>L3 elective modules to recommend or not ?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    No, it all depends on what you like. Do not hesitate to discuss this kind of
                    subject with your godfather or your godmother, they are here for that.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Is the canteen good?</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                  Don't worry, you'll be able to eat your fill ! Our chefs are always there to
                  prepare good balanced dishes with several options. Vegetarian can also find meals
                  specially prepared for them !
