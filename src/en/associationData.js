      "assoDescription":"Good day to you champion, <br /> Bravo for your integration into this legendary school: IMT Lille Douai. Here you will finally, after two or three years of hard work, discover the real student life. With the many parties, events and outings organized by the various offices / associations / committees. In addition, you will be able to start practicing your favorite sport discipline. During your first year, practicing sport is mandatory. Nevertheless you shouldn’t worry, sporty or not, your favorite BDS will be there for you. Our role at the school is to supervise all sport related activities, that is to say if you have contributed to the association. We will provide you with a license to participate in competitions and wear the colors of our school. The BDS also manages all the logistics for inter-school sports events and championships, which will be numerous. With the help of the captains we will take care of the sports equipment, in case there's any problem with it. Let your captain know and we'll take care of it! In addition to sport, we’re also there so you can benefit from the associative life of Douais. Outings will be organized throughout the year, and you can enjoy them at a reduced price, if you contributed. We will offer activities such as paintball, karting, outings to see matches in Lille or Lens and match broadcasts (football, rugby, basketball, handball, Formula 1, etc.) at the Lavoisier bar. Lavoisier is also equipped with a weight room, with new equipment, which will allow you to resume training near your home. Make the most of your summer and we look forward to seeing you in Douai to enjoy your integration! <br /> Alas’kiss",
